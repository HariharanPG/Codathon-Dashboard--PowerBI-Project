# Codathon-Dashboard--PowerBI-Project

This repository showcases the Codathon Dashboard, which tracks the daily progress of students solving coding problems. The dashboard provides real-time updates based on a Google Sheet where students log their completed tasks. As a Student Placement Coordinator, I created this dashboard to ensure seamless monitoring of student performance and problem-solving consistency.

**You can view the live dashboard here:** [Codathon Dashboard](https://www.novypro.com/project/codathon---analysis).

## 👉🏻Key Features
**Daily Problem Tracking:** Monitors the number of problems each student solves daily, ensuring consistent progress.

**Real-Time Updates:** The dashboard auto-updates as students fill out the Google Sheet, providing up-to-the-minute insights.

**Student Performance Overview:** Displays each student's coding test completion status, highlighting those meeting the daily target and those falling behind.

**Placement Coordinator View:** Simplifies the tracking process for placement coordinators to evaluate students' problem-solving abilities and follow their progress.

## 👉🏻 Objective
**The Codathon Dashboard aims to:**

  Provide a clear visual representation of students' daily coding test progress.
  
  Help placement coordinators easily track and manage the students' readiness for technical placements by ensuring daily coding practice.

## 👉🏻 Dataset
The dashboard is powered by a Google Sheet where students enter:
    Date
